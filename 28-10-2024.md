# Sorting a python dictionary

https://realpython.com/sort-python-dictionary/#using-the-key-parameter-and-lambda-functions

"The typical method for sorting dictionaries is to get a dictionary view, sort
it, and then cast the resulting list back into a dictionary. So you effectively
go from a dictionary to a list and back into a dictionary. Depending on your
use case, you may not need to convert **the list** back into a dictionary."

> [!NOTE]
> Sorted dictionaries aren’t a very common pattern. You’ll explore more
> about that topic later in [the tutorial](https://realpython.com/sort-python-dictionary/#judging-whether-you-want-to-use-a-sorted-dictionary).

In this section, you’ll be putting together the components of sorting a
dictionary so that, in the end, you can master the most common way of sorting a
dictionary:

```python
people = {3: "Jim", 2: "Jack", 4: "Jane", 1: "Jill"}

# Sort by key
dict(sorted(people.items()))
# {1: 'Jill', 2: 'Jack', 3: 'Jim', 4: 'Jane'}

# Sort by value
dict(sorted(people.items(), key=lambda item: item[1]))
# {2: 'Jack', 4: 'Jane', 1: 'Jill', 3: 'Jim'}
```

# Using the sorted() function

The critical function that you’ll use to sort dictionaries is the built-in
sorted() function. This function takes an iterable as the main argument, with
two optional keyword-only arguments—a key function and a reverse Boolean value.

> [!NOTE]
> Every list also has a .sort() method, which has the same signature as the
> sorted() function. The main difference is that the .sort() method sorts the
> list in-place. In contrast, the sorted() function returns a new list, leaving
> the original list unmodified.

So, how about dictionaries? You can actually take the dictionary and feed it
straight into the sorted() function:

```python
people = {3: "Jim", 2: "Jack", 4: "Jane", 1: "Jill"}
sorted(people)
```

But the default behavior of passing in a dictionary directly to the sorted()
function is to take the keys of the dictionary, sort them, and return a list of
the keys only. That’s probably not the behavior you had in mind! To preserve
all the information in a dictionary, you’ll need to be acquainted with
**dictionary views**.

# Getting Keys, Values, or Both From a Dictionary

If you want to conserve all the information from a dictionary when sorting it,
the typical first step is to call the .items() method on the dictionary.
Calling .items() on the dictionary will provide an iterable of tuples
representing the key-value pairs:

```python
people = {3: "Jim", 2: "Jack", 4: "Jane", 1: "Jill"}
people.items()
```

The **.items()** method returns a **read-only dictionary view object**, which serves as
a window into the dictionary. This view is not a copy or a list—it’s a
read-only iterable that’s actually linked to the dictionary it was generated
from:

```python
people = {3: "Jim", 2: "Jack", 4: "Jane", 1: "Jill"}
view = people.items()
people[2] = "Elvis"
view
```

# Using the key Parameter and Lambda Functions

For example, if you want to sort by **value**, then you have to specify **a sort key**.
A sort key is a way **to extract** a **comparable value**. For instance, if you have a
pile of books, then you might use the author surname as the sort key. With the
**sorted()** function, you can specify **a sort key** by passing a [[callback function]] as
a key argument.

> [!NOTE]
> The **key** argument has nothing to do with a dictionary key!

To see a sort key in action, take a look at this example, which is similar to
the one you saw in the section introducing the sorted() function:

```python
people = {3: "Jim", 2: "Jack", 4: "Jane", 1: "Jill"}

# Sort key
def value_getter(item):
    return item[1]


sorted(people.items(), key=value_getter)


# Or with a lambda function
sorted(people.items(), key=lambda item: item[1])
# people dictionary is here returned as a lit of tuples.
```

- Véase: [[lambda]]

Since the default behavior of sorted() with tuples is to sort
lexicographically, the key parameter allows you to select a value from the
element that it’s comparing.

In the next section, you’ll take sort keys a bit further and use them to sort
by a nested value.

implementation()
- https://neovim.io/doc/user/lsp.html#vim.lsp.buf.implementation()


implementation({opts}) **vim.lsp.buf.implementation()**
**Lists all the implementations** for **the symbol** under the cursor in **the quickfix window**.
Parameters:
{opts} (vim.lsp.LocationOpts?) See vim.lsp.LocationOpts.

- What's the difference?

references({context}, {opts}) **vim.lsp.buf.references()**
Lists all the references to the symbol under the cursor in the quickfix window.
Parameters:
{context} (table?) Context for the request
{opts} (vim.lsp.ListOpts?) See vim.lsp.ListOpts.
